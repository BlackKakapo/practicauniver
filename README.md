# Light Work

This is my first internship project for university. 
Here for the first time I made a project based on 
**Spring Boot**.

I used:
1. Spring Boot
2. PostgresSQL
3. Freemarker
4. Hibernate 
5. Heroku

The web application is a small forum, 
where you can write an article (those who 
have the role of 'Private' or 'Admin' can write).

And of course the main idea was to calculate the: 
- Basal metabolic rate
- Daily calorie requirement
- Your body mass index
   - Result
   - Requirements

#### Simple calcualtion

And for advance, you can indicate:
- Indicate your scope (Lose / Gain weight)
- How much do you want to lose / gain weight?
- How much proteins do you want?
- How much fats do you want?

#### Advance calcualtion

And for last, I deployed on **[heroku](https://practicauniver.herokuapp.com)**. 
Because is free and easy to use.
